## Breast Cancer Predictor
This mini project demonstrates a Streamlit application for predicting whether a breast mass is benign or malignant based on various cellular measurements. The application leverages machine learning models to assist in breast cancer diagnosis through interactive visualizations and predictions.

Project Features:
- Interactive Radar Charts: Displays cellular measurements including mean, standard error, and worst-case values for comparison.
- Predictive Modeling: Uses a trained machine learning model to predict if a breast mass is benign or malignant. Shows probabilities for both outcomes.
- User Input: Allows users to input measurements via sliders to update predictions and visualizations in real-time.
Technologies Used:
- Programming Language: Python
- Machine Learning: Scikit-learn
- Web Framework: Streamlit
- Visualization: Plotly
- Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy
- Development Tools: Visual Studio
How It Works:
- Data Input: Users can adjust sliders to input measurements for different cellular attributes.
- Radar Chart Visualization: Compares the input measurements to average, standard error, and worst-case values through radar charts.
- Prediction and Probability: Provides a prediction of benign or malignant with associated probabilities based on the input data.
Note:
- This application serves as a tool for assisting healthcare professionals in diagnosing breast cancer but should not be used as a substitute for professional medical advice.
